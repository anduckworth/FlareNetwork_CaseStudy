Incorporated in 2019

The founders of the Flare Network are Hugo Philion (Co-Founder and CEO) & Sean Rowan (Co-Founder and CTO)

The exact nature of how the idea came about is not clear, however it appears that it would have come from the strategic partnership with Ripple and the intention to unlock the value of the XRP token.

Flare Network has only been through one funding round. It was a Venture funding, raised on November 6, 2019. The funds came from Xpring, the venture arm of the company Ripple.

## Business Activities

Flare Network aims to solve two problems that are currently present in competitor blockchain networks. The first problem is that 75% of the value that exists in current public blockchains cannot be used in a trustless manner with smart contracts, so Flare's objective is to unlock this value. The second problem is scalability of a blockchain network. Currently, the most scalable solution is proof of stake or it's variants. The main issue with proof of stake is that the consensus protocol design does not yet readily allow alternate uses of the native token in a safe manner.
