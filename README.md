Incorporated in 2019

The founders of the Flare Network are Hugo Philion (Co-Founder and CEO) & Sean Rowan (Co-Founder and CTO)

The exact nature of how the idea came about is not clear, however it appears that it would have come from the strategic partnership with Ripple and the intention to unlock the value of the XRP token.

Flare Network has only been through one funding round. It was a Venture funding, raised on November 6, 2019. The funds came from Xpring, the venture arm of the company Ripple.

## Business Activities

Flare Network aims to solve two problems that are currently present in competitor blockchain networks. The first problem is that 75% of the value that exists in current public blockchains cannot be used in a trustless manner with smart contracts, so Flare's objective is to unlock this value. The second problem is scalability of a blockchain network. Currently, the most scalable solution is proof of stake or it's variants. The main issue with proof of stake is that the consensus protocol design does not yet readily allow alternate uses of the native token in a safe manner.

Flare Network's intention is to impact areas of the world with high power concentrations, especially less developed areas, to implement a safe platform for co-operation that can help remedy the imbalance of equality. Certain inequalities can even exist in current blockchains, such as proof of stake networks, where large token holders can drive the price up through locking value in staking. This solution is found in the fundamentals of the Flare Network, the Flare Consensus Protocol (FCP). The FCP is a new construction of Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) which makes it excessively difficult for malicious actors to influence or attack the network and transactions within the network.

The Flare Consensus Protocol incorporates blockchain to create a network that supports turing completeness, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This combination allows for universal computation, meaning the system allows for trustless interoperability with other networks. This is different from other FBA protocols which currently only support non turing completeness. Using the Ethereum Virtual Machine is what allows this to occur. In addition to this, the Flare network also incorporates the Flare Token, Spark. Spark enables holders to take part in decentralized governence of the network. Governance and consensus go hand in hand, and are tracked by a directed acyclic graph. This allows for spark holders to make decisions on parties they trust, and for the network to track paths of trust to confirm transactions as a  whole. A major part of the governance and consensus is the Flare Time Series Oracle. The main purpose of the FTSO is to form accurate estimates of off-chain date on Flare, while retaining decentralization. An example of this is the XRP/Spark price time series.

## Landscape

Flare operates as a blockchain company. They are primarily a framework for other decentralized applications, referred to as Spark Depenedant Applications (SDA). On the Flare Network, SDAs are applications that incorporate the use of the Spark token in its construction. Examples of such use cases are spark as collateral, the FTSO, and the spark token as a means of network governance for individual holders. These three use cases apply to the network itself. Therefore, enabling Spark holders to participate directly in the network. The additional purpose of such a framework is to extend these fundamental use cases of the Spark token to other applications built on top of the network.

The major trends and innovations of this domanin over the past five to ten years have been extensive given the growth of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Cryptocurrency has been able to grab the public's attention, in large part due to the massive gains made by speculative buyers. There are also a significant amount of retail investors and financial institutions who have moved into the cryptocurrency space to get in early on what is considered a new asset class with significant use cases for top projects. The use cases cryptocurrency and blockchain typically have to do with new and improved forms of consensus and ledger technologies with smart contract capabilities, decentralized finance, decentralized application development, etc. Up to this point in time, the most popular projects utilize proof of work consensus or proof of stake consensus. This is where the Flare Network differs most. Their Flare Consensus Protocol uses a proprietary form of federated byzantine agreement which considerably increases saftey from malicious actors, thus allowing for increased scalability, trustless issuance of digital assets, tustless interoperability between blockchains, and a stable network for decentralized application development.

The most notable projects that bear a resemblance to the Flare Netwrok are Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, and the Interledger protocol. 

## Results

The Flare Network has not officially launched. The official launch is still to be determined, but it's expected launch is end of Q1 or Q2 of 2021. Although the Flare Network has not officially launched, there is a lot of activity surrounding the network already. Flare's first partnership was with Ripple and the XRP token. Flare will be hosting a wrapped version of the XRP token, FXRP, which will allow XRP holders to utilize it with smart contract capabilities. This is what Flare considers unlocking value in digital assets through use of turing completeness and interoperability between blockchains. XRP holders also received the airdrop of the Spark token in December of 2020. Since the air drop of the spark token to XRP holders, Flare has also announced that they will be hosting wrapped versions of LiteCoin (LTC) and DogeCoin (Doge). In addition to hosting the wrapped versions of these tokens, they will also support Non-Fungible tokens from the blockchain games development company Gala Games. Furthermore, announcements have begun from projects that intend to develop decentralized applications on the Flare Netwrok such as Flare Finance and Flare Fusion. Since these projects will act as Spark Dependant Applications (SDAs) they will not only provide their intended service to participants in the Flare Network, but they will also act as FTSO signal providers to the network. Spark token holders can delegate their governance votes to these projects based on independent considerations of trust and commission structure (commission on from daily rewards paid back to token holders for taking part in FTSO voting).

The two major metrics used in this domain to measure success are consensus and scalability, both of which the Flare Network excels at. The reason for the Flare Network's projected dominance in these two metrics is due to the Flare Consensus Protocol. Their proprietary version of federated byzantine agreement allows for an extremely strong defense against malicious actors succeeding in network dominance. Once a malicious actor is detected, participants can choose not to approve of the actors actions and essentially block these actions. This is a significant improvement in network safety because in proof of work and proof of stake, network dominance can very easily become concentrated. For example, in the Bitcoin proof of work model, over 50% of the algorithmic mining takes place in China and has significant backing by the Chinese government. In addition to this, proof of stake can be risky because the safety of the network is based on the amount of tokens staked, so malicious actors can stake large quantities of tokens, which locks up the supply of tokens and increases the value of the tokens, making it difficult to decentralize the concentration of token ownership. In the same way, scalability is also improved using the FCP because it is much more efficient than proof of work or proof of stake. It can also be argued that the Spark token itself has a competitive advantage over the tokens of proof of stake networks because it can be used on the blockchaain while still earning rewards and gaining utility rather than being locked up in staking.

Overall, it appears that the Flare Network will outperform other blockchain networks given it's advanced use of blockchain technology. However, it is still too early to tell for sure.

## Recommendations

Since the Flare Network is naturally inflationary due to the daily rewards distributed to participants' voting on FTSO accuracy, I believe it would be meaningful to create a credit card that enables the user to earn additional spark tokens with purchases.

This would benefit the company by creating more awareness for the utility of the spark token. If the regular consumer can go out and buy their every day items as they normally would, while earning spark tokens, it would promote growth of the network. This would foster an even stronger consensus based on voting, as well as generate more users for the Spark Dependent Applications.

Spark has hired software engineers from Towo labs to create a wallet that could hold spark tokens and the wrapped assets to create ease of use. The credit card could be integrated to this function and allow participants to pay off their credit lines with fiat or cryptocurrency while earning their rewards.

The integration of credit to the upcoming wallet would be appropriate because it would essentially create a decentralized banking function for the Flare Network.
