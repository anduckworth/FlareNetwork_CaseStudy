## Overview and Origin

Flare Network

Incorporated in 2019

The founders of the Flare Network are Hugo Philion (Co-Founder and CEO) & Sean Rowan (Co-Founder and CTO)

The exact nature of how the idea came about is not clear, however it appears that it would have come from the strategic partnership with Ripple and the intention to unlock the value of the XRP token.

Flare Network has only been through one funding round. It was a Venture funding, raised on November 6, 2019. The funds came from Xpring, the venture arm of the company Ripple.

## Business Activities

Flare Network aims to solve two problems that are currently present in competitor blockchain networks. The first problem is that 75% of the value that exists in current public blockchains cannot be used in a trustless manner with smart contracts, so Flare's objective is to unlock this value. The second problem is scalability of a blockchain network. Currently, the most scalable solution is proof of stake or it's variants. The main issue with proof of stake is that the consensus protocol design does not yet readily allow alternate uses of the native token in a safe manner.

Flare Network's intention is to impact areas of the world with high power concentrations, especially less developed areas, to implement a safe platform for co-operation that can help remedy the imbalance of equality. Certain inequalities can even exist in current blockchains, such as proof of stake networks, where large token holders can drive the price up through locking value in staking. This solution is found in the fundamentals of the Flare Network, the Flare Consensus Protocol (FCP). The FCP is a new construction of Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) which makes it excessively difficult for malicious actors to influence or attack the network and transactions within the network.

The Flare Consensus Protocol incorporates blockchain to create a network that supports turing completeness, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This combination allows for universal computation, meaning the system allows for trustless interoperability with other networks. This is different from other FBA protocols which currently only support non turing completeness. Using the Ethereum Virtual Machine is what allows this to occur. In addition to this, the Flare network also incorporates the Flare Token, Spark. Spark enables holders to take part in decentralized governence of the network. Governance and consensus go hand in hand, and are tracked by a directed acyclic graph. This allows for spark holders to make decisions on parties they trust, and for the network to track paths of trust to confirm transactions as a  whole. A major part of the governance and consensus is the Flare Time Series Oracle. The main purpose of the FTSO is to form accurate estimates of off-chain date on Flare, while retaining decentralization. An example of this is the XRP/Spark price time series.

## Landscape

Flare operates as a blockchain company. They are primarily a framework for other decentralized applications, referred to as Spark Depenedant Applications (SDA). On the Flare Network, SDAs are applications that incorporate the use of the Spark token in its construction. Examples of such use cases are spark as collateral, the FTSO, and the spark token as a means of network governance for individual holders. These three use cases apply to the network itself. Therefore, enabling Spark holders to participate directly in the network. The additional purpose of such a framework is to extend these fundamental use cases of the Spark token to other applications built on top of the network.

The major trends and innovations of this domanin over the past five to ten have been extensive given the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The most notable projects that have come to exist are Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, and the Interledger protocol.
